# MindBloom

This is an AI-powered web application designed to provide initial mental health support to users by categorizing their concerns into:
🧘‍♀️ Common Mental Distress (CMD)
🧠 Severe Mental Illness (SMI)
👶 Developmental & Behavioral Disorders
It uses LangGraph, LangChain, and LLM agents to simulate early-stage mental health triaging, and offers friendly, non-judgmental responses.

Note: This app does not diagnose or treat conditions — it encourages seeking professional help.
